## About Me

Hi, I’m Sriya. I’m a B.Tech student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I really enjoy exploring technology and building things from scratch. I like learning by doing — whether that means coding a web project, experimenting with embedded systems, or understanding how larger systems work.

This portfolio is a collection of my projects and ideas, and it reflects my learning journey so far. I’m curious by nature, always trying to improve my skills, and excited about working on meaningful and challenging problems.
